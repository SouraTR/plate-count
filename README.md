# plate-count
Counts number of colonies in a petri plate

Using opencv library I managed to count numbers of colonies in a petri plate
Get the number of colonies as the shape of "detected_circles" numpy array

Code needs a lot of optimization and automation

# Current Goals

  1. Better detection parameters
  2. Single window
 
# Libraries
  skimage
  matplotlib
  numpy
  open-cv

# Steps
  1. change the path variable to the location of image of plate
  2. ...
